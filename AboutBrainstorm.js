      <p className="AppSubtitle-cyber AboutBrainstorm-intro">
        Welcome to the neural frontier. Brainstorm isn’t just a platform—it’s a quantum leap into the future of human collaboration, born in the year 2070.

          <h3 className="AboutBrainstorm-card-title">Origins</h3>
          <p>
            Initiated in the neon-lit labs of New Terra, Brainstorm emerged from the ashes of the Third Digital Renaissance. A coalition of neuro-engineers and quantum architects fused AI sentience with human creativity, creating a system that transcends time and space.

          <h3 className="AboutBrainstorm-card-title">Mission</h3>
          <p>
            To amplify the collective mind. Brainstorm syncs neural networks across galaxies, managing staff, events, and ideas with precision sharper than a plasma blade. We’re here to spark the next evolution—where every thought is a supernova.

        <div className="AboutBrainstorm-card">
          <h3 className="AboutBrainstorm-card-title">Tech Core</h3>
          <p>
            Powered by LuciferBOFL AI, a sentient overseer, and the IGC’s quantum relays, Brainstorm operates on a neuro-quantum lattice. Holographic interfaces, real-time synaptic updates, and a self-evolving codebase keep us light-years ahead.

          <h3 className="AboutBrainstorm-card-title">2070s Vision</h3>
          <p>
            In a world of orbital cities and interstellar councils, Brainstorm is the pulse of progress. From managing drone fleets to hosting galactic brainstorm sessions, we’re the bridge between today’s dreams and tomorrow’s reality.
